1. Project Title
Spiral Rainbow Hearts

2. What is the purpose of your project? Explain about your project

The Rainbow Spiral Hearts project is designed to create a visually appealing, colorful spiral that smoothly transitions through the rainbow colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).
At the center of the spiral is a heart, symbolizing love, while another heart is positioned at the end of the spiral to represent continuity and connection. The project demonstrates how simple mathematical patterns,
such as spirals and heart shapes, can be combined with colors and coordinates to generate beautiful designs using Python and the matplotlib library. It's a perfect example of integrating mathematics, art, and programming 
to produce creative, aesthetically pleasing results.
